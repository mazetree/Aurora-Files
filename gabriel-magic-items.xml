			<p>A small, irregular light blue crystal hangs on a simple leather necklace. You feel crackling arcane energy on your fingertips as you touch it and small blue bolts of light pass from the crystal to your outstretched hand. You feel your connection to the pool of wild magic strengthen and your ability to channel it improves.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Conduit can hold up to three charges. It gains charges in response to you channelling your wild magic rage in combat - when you roll a natural 19 while raging the Conduit gains a single charge. When you roll a natural 20 while raging the Conduit gains two charges.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can channel the wild magic in the Conduit to empower your attacks while raging. When you hit with a weapon attack on your turn you can use a bonus action to expend a number of charges of your choice. When you do so, first roll a d4 - on a 1-3 roll a d8 and use the table below to determine the damage type. If you roll a 4 you may choose the damage type. For each charge expended you deal an extra d8 of that damage type.</p>
			<p class="indent">When fully charged with three charges, the Conduit gives extra precision to your wild magic raging. When raging for the first time in combat you may expend all three Conduit charges and choose the WIld Surge effect that takes effect.</p>

			<p><i>Igneous soulblade (cursed) +1 greatsword</i></p>
			<p>At the end of a long rest make a DC 14 wisdom saving throw. You can voluntarily fail this save. On a failed save, role a d12. Subtract the result from your hitpoint maximum and add the die closest to the result to damage inflicted by the weapon as fire damage, rounded down. For instance, roll 1d10 of extra fire damage on a roll of 11. You cannot determine the consequences should you fail three saves on consecutive days.</p>

			<p>When you stow a greatsword in the sheath you can insert a vial of alchemical oil into the mechanism, causing it to coat the weapon as it exists in an extraplanar pocket dimension.

	<element name="Cold Iron Javelin" type="Magic Item" source="Dhurn Toldur Campaign" id="ID_GABRIEL_COLD_JAVELIN">
		<supports>ID_INTERNAL_WEAPON_PROPERTY_FINESSE</supports>
		<description>
			<p>This thin, sleek javelin is ice cold to the touch and saps the warmth of your hand as you touch it. It is a single, continuous piece of metal, forged from a single, simple mould. Surprisingly heavy given its slender shaft, it shines with a slightly dullish blue grey light.</p>
			<p class="indent">This javelin has +1 to attack and damage rolls. </p>
			<p class="indent">Once you have attuned to this weapon, you can use a bonus action to temporarily sever your connection between body and soul as you throw it. Once you have done so, make an attack roll as usual. On a hit, it deals an additional 3d8 radiant damage (for good) or necrotic damage (for evil). In addition, you project your soul into a spectral manifestation of yourself in an unoccupied space within 5ft of your target. This manifestation is a  translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, or until you're incapacitated.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your manifestation has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the soul manifestation to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 90 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the manifestationâ€™s space.</p>
			<p class="indent">You make this choice for each attack. After attacking with the javelin it returns to your hand. When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your manifestation moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the echo's space. When your manifestation is destroyed, make a constitution save (DC = 15 or half of the damage taken, whichever is higher). If you fail, you are incapacitated until the end of your next turn. Once you have manifested your soul in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a short rest.</p>
